    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and
        CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.</p>
    <p> clinet side scripting/programming lang = Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the
        client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime
        system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.(real world entities)

    <p>Features of JavaScript
        There are following features of JavaScript:
        <ol>
            <li> All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
            <li> JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.</li>
            <li> JavaScript is a weakly/loosly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).</li>
            <li> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.</li>
            <li> It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
            <li> It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
            <li> JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
            <li> It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>History of JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to
        be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser.
        But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named
        'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript
        came into existence.</p>
